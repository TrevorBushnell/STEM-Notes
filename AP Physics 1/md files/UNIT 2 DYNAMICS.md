# UNIT 2: DYNAMICS

[toc]



## 2.1: Systems

* **System:** an object/collection of objects in which physical properties can be applied to
* Systems have properties that are determined by the properties and interactions of their atomic and molecular substructures
  * It's always important to consider what is going on at both a *molecular level* and a *macro level*
  * When the properties of the constituent parts are not important in modeling the behavior of the macroscopic system, the system can be referred to as an object



## 2.2: The Gravitational Field

* **Mass:** how much material is contained in an object (SI Unit: kg)
* **Gravitational force:** force exerted on an object due to gravitational forces of a planet or other object
* **Weight:** the force of a planet acting on an object
* $F_g (\text{or } F_W) = mg$
  * $m$ = mass of the object
  * $g$ = acceleration due to gravity $= 9.8 \frac{m}{s^2}$ or approximately $10 \frac{m}{s}$
* On Earth, gravitational force is also called **weight** (hence why $F_W$ is acceptable and common
* To find the magnitude of the gravitational field at any point in space (so not necessarily on the Earth), divide the force due to gravity by the mass of the object
  * $ g_{specific\: location} = \frac{F_g}{m}$
* If the gravitational force is the *only* force acting on an object (the object is in free fall), then the acceleration of the object is the same as the magnitude of the gravitational field at that location ($a_g = g_{specific\:location}$)



## 2.3: Constant Forces

* **FORCE:** a push or pull that acts on an object (SI Unit: Newtons)
* Force is measured with a spring scale or a platform scale
* Forces in the *same direction* **add together** to determine the net force
* Force in the *opposite direction* **subtract** to determine the net force
* The net force is always in the direction of acceleration

* A **constant force** is a force that results from the interaction of one object touching another object



### 2.3.1: Types of Forces

* **FRICTION FORCE:** Force of a surface on an object acting/moving along that surface
  * Friction always acts **opposite** to the object's motion
  * $F_f = \mu F_n$
  * $\mu$ is the *coefficient of friction* and is a scalar and NOT a vector
  * $\mu$ tells you how sticky two surfaces are
  * *coefficient of kinetic friction* is used when an object is moving
    * $F_f = \mu_k F_N$
  * *coefficient of static friction* is used when an object is not moving
    * $F_f \ge m_sF_N$
* **NORMAL FORCE:** The force of a surface on an object in contact with the surface
  * Normal force always acts *perpendicular* to the surface
  * A platform scale actually weighs the normal force and not the weight
  * $F_N=F_W$
* **TENSION FORCE:** The force caused by a rope/string/chain holding up an object or system
  * Use geometry/trigonometry to find the magnitudes of tension forces
* **SPRING FORCE:** The force caused by a spring on an object
  * $F_s = kx$ where $k$ is the spring constant and $x$ is how much the spring was displaced



### 2.3.2: Perpendicular Forces

* When two concurrent forces are acting perpendicular to each other, then the resultant force is:
  * **greater** if the forces acted in opposite directions
  * **less** if the forces acted in the same direction
  * **at an angle** but closer to the larger force
* To determine the resultant force geometrically, draw the forces to scale, create a rectangle, and measure the diagonal of the rectangle and its angle



### 2.3.3: Forces and Components

* Any diagonal force can be written in terms of two perpendicular force components (x and y components)
* $F_x = F\cos\theta$
* $F_y = F\sin\theta$
* $\theta$ is the angle between the force and the x-axis



### 2.3.4: Inclined Planes

* When an object is on an inclined plane, break the object's weight into components parallel to and perpendicular to the incline (**not x and y axes**)
  * Component of the object's weight parallel to the incline is $mg\sin\theta$
  * Component of the object's weight perpendicular to the incline is $mg\cos\theta$



## 2.4: Newton's First Law

* An object in motion will remain in motion unless acted on by another force



## 2.5: Newton's Third Law and Free-Body Diagrams



### 2.5.1: Newton's Third Law

* The force of an object A on another object B is **equal** to the force of object B on said object A
* If an object exerts a force on  a second object, the second object always exerts a force of equal magnitude on the first object in the *opposite direction*
* A **third law force pair** is a pair of forces that obeys Newton's Third Law
* Two forces in a third law force pair can never act on the same object



### 2.5.2: Free Body Diagrams

* A free body diagram includes:
  1. A labeled arrow representing each force, beginning on the object and pointing in the direction in which the force acts
  2. A list of the forces, indicating the object applying said force and the object experiencing said force



## 2.6: Newton's Second Law

* Forces acting in the same direction add together to determine the net force
* Forces acting in opposite directions subtract to determine the net force

* An object's acceleration can be represented as $a = \frac{\sum F}{m}$
* An object is in equilibrium if $\sum F_x$ and $\sum F_y$ are equal to 0
  * This means the object can be at rest or moving at a constant speed



### 2.6.1: Solving All Problems Involving Forces

1. Draw a FBD, breaking angled forces into components if necessary
2. Write two equations for Newton's Second Law in each direction
   * $\sum F_x = ma$
   * $\sum F_y = ma$
3. Solve the above equations





## 2.7: Applications of Newton's Second Law

* The knowledge of kinematics and Newton's Second Law can be used together to help solve and address many physics problems and scenarios
