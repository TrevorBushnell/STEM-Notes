## 3.1: Vector Fields

* A vector field gives (as a function of time and sometimes position) the value of a physical quantity that can be described by a vector
  * Represented by field vectors indicating direction and magnitude
  * A vector field can be used to make inferences about the number, relative size, and location of various sources





## 3.2: Fundamental Forces

* FUNDAMENTAL FORCES include, *gravitational forces*, *weak nuclear forces*, *strong nuclear forces*, and *electromagnetic forces*
* Gravitational forces are exerted at all scales between all objects and are able to have magnitude at extremely large distances away





## 3.3: Gravitational and Electric Forces

* **GRAVITATIONAL FORCES:** Forces that describe the interaction between one object with mass and another object with mass
* Gravitational force is always attractive
* $|F_g| = G\frac{m_1m_2}{d^2}$
  * $G = 6.67 \times 10^{-11} \frac{Nm^2}{kg^2}$
  * $d = $ center-to-center distance between the objects
* In a small range of heights above Earth's surface, the gravitational field on Earth ($g$) is approximately constant
* Electric Forces talked about later in the course and addressed in depth in AP Physics 2





## 3.4: Gravitational Field and Acceleration Due to Gravity on Different Planets

* A gravitational field $\vec g$ at the location of an object with mass $m$ will cause a gravitational force with magnitude $mg$ to be exerted on the object in the direction of the gravitational field
  * Gravitational force known as weight on Earth
* $\vec g = \frac{F_g}{m}$
  * Keep in mind that $F_g$ is also a vector!
* If the only force acting on an object is the gravitational force, then the *acceleration due to gravity* is equal to the magnitude of the gravitational field
* $g = G\frac{m}{d^2}$
  * $\therefore$ gravitational field caused by a sphere object containing mass is radial
  * In AP Physics, only *spherically symmetric objects* will be considered sources of the gravitational field





## Inertial VS Gravitational Mass

* **gravitational mass:** property of an object/system that determines the strength of the gravitational interaction with other objects
  * measured by measuring said object's weight ($mg$)
* **inertial mass:** measured by finding the net force on an object, measuring the acceleration, and solving for $m$ in $\sum F = ma$

* In all experiments ever performed, gravitational mass is equal to inertial mass





## 3.6: Centripetal Acceleration and Centripetal Force

* **centripetal acceleration:** the acceleration that causes an object/system to move in a circle
* $a_{c} = \frac{v^2}{r}$
* centripetal acceleration is always directed towards the center of the circle
* angular acceleration changes an object's *rotational speed* while centripetal acceleration *changes an object's direction of motion*



### 3.6.1: Rotational Kinematics Recap

* Rotational kinematics I feel should be addressed here, so I have re-included the relevant information here

* **ANGULAR DISPLACEMENT** ($\theta$): The total angle you have rotated in a circular fashion from a starting point on a circle
  * vector (has a direction and magnitude)
  * $\Delta\theta = \theta_f-\theta_i$
* **ANGULAR VELOCITY** ($\omega$): The velocity at which you rotate around a circle
  * vector (has direction and magnitude)
  * $\omega = \frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t}$
* **ANGULAR ACCELERATION** ($\alpha$): How fast you change your angular velocity in a given amount of time
  * vector (has a direction and magnitude)
  * $\alpha = \frac{\Delta \omega}{\Delta t}$
* **CENTRIPETAL ACCELERATION** ($a_c$): The acceleration that causes an object to move in circle

> The rotational kinematics equations are equations that relate angular displacement, angular acceleration, initial angular velocity, final angular velocity, and time. They are as follows:
> $$
> \Delta\theta=\omega t + \frac{1}{2}\alpha t^2\\
> \omega_f = \omega_i + \alpha t\\
> \omega_f^2 = \omega_i^2 + 2\alpha\Delta\theta
> $$

* NOTE: These equations only work when the angular acceleration is *constant*
* These equations work when there is both a radial and tangential acceleration

> RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ANGULAR AND LINEAR MOTION:
> $$
> \Delta x = r\Delta\theta\\
> v = r\omega\\
> a = r\alpha
> $$
> NOTE: $r = $ the distance from the rotational axis (the radius of the circle being drawn from the motion)



## 3.7: Free Body Diagrams for Objects in Circular Motion

* When drawing FBD for objects in circular motion, there is always a force pointing towards the center of rotation (the center of the circle being drawn)
  * This force varies depending on the situation so pay attention to context!
  * EX: A ball on a string would have a tension force pointed towards the center
  * EX: A car going around a turn would have a friction force pointed towards the center
* Remember in these cases that $\sum F = ma_c$





## 3.8: Applications of Circular Motion

* Using kinematics (both linear and rotational) and forces, you can solve many everyday physics problems and scenarios
