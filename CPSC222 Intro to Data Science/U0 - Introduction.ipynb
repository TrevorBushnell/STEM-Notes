    "\n",
    "In data science, we generally use the programming language **Python**, which is the third most popular general-purpose language in the world. We use Python because it is incredibly easy to learn. We also use it because Python has extensive library support, and there are many different libraries that you can import and use for your data science work (this means there is a lot of code already written for you so that you don't have to write code to do various operations from scratch, for exammple computing a t-test).\n",
