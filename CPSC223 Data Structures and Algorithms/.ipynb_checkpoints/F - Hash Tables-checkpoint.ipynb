    "> Q: Is this a good has function?\n",
    "> * FAST: it's slower than the last algorithm, but at least it's independent of the size of the table so still fast\n",
    "> * EVENLY DISTRIBUTES: this doesn't evenly distribute (if anything maybe it normally distributes? - would be curious to see that)\n",

    "* we could do a function where we multiply each cluster of three digits and then add them together, etc. etc.\n",
