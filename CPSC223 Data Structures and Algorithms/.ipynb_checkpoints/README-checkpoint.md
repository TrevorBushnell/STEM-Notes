# CPSC223 Data Structures and Algorithms Notes

All of these notes are taken in Jupyter notebooks with runnable code inside so that you can see the notes I took and the code that I used to write the notes with.

I wrote all of my code in C++14. C++11 works but was old and the C++17 kernel just never loads (it will try to load and then kinda just stop and then everything just becomes plain text).
