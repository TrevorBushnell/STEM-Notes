    "* When doing complexity analysis, we care about this input size $n$\n",
    "    * We analyze algorithms in terms of the size of their input (e.g. Sequence has $n$ elements)\n",
    "    * Reason for this is because most algorithms take longer to run as $n \\to \\infty$\n",
    "    \n",
    "* \"Worst/Best case analysis:\" Certain input patterns for any $n$ that take the most/least amount of time\n",
    "    * Usually Big-O notation talks about the worst case (but not always)\n",
    "    \n",
    "* \"Average case analysis:\" The average amount of time over all cases for all $n$\n",
    "    * Usually you have to figure out the distribution of cases to better understand your average case analysis\n",
    "    * We won't generally do this in this class\n",
    "    \n",
    "* \"Count primitive operations:\" instead of timing something, we look at the underlying assembly operations that make the algorithm happen and assume how long these assembly operations take\n",
    "    * What are the primitive operations?\n",
    "    * How many times do these operations happen?\n",
