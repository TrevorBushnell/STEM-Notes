    "\n",
    "### Selecting Digits\n",
    "\n",
    "* select specific parts/digits of (integer) keys to use as the has value (index)\n",
    "* EX: 9-digit student IDs\n",
    "    * Let `h(k)` = the 4th and 9th digit\n",
    "    * `h(001364825) = 35`\n",
    "    * insert the KV-pair into the hash table at index 35\n",
    "* note that with strings you can get the ASCII representation of the string to do the same thing\n",
    "\n",
    "> Q: Is this a good has function?\n",
    "> * FAST: it's constant time both with respect to the size of the table *and* the size of the key\n",
    "> * EVENLY DISTRIBUTES: it depends on the keys being used and the size of the has table\n",
    ">    * the bigger your hash table the more empty buckets you have\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Folding\n",
    "\n",
    "* add (sum) the digits of the key\n",
    "* 9 digit integer key, $\\therefore$ `h(k) = i_1 + i_2 + ... + i_n`\n",
    "\n",
    "> Q: Is this a good has function?\n",
    "> * FAST: it's slower than the last algorithm, but at least it's independent of the size of the table so still fast\n",
    "> * EVENLY DISTRIBUTES: this doesn't evenly distribute (if anything maybe it normally distributes? - would be curious to see that)\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Combination of the Previous Two\n",
    "\n",
    "* we could do a function where we multiply each cluster of three digits and then add them together, etc. etc.\n",
    "* a good hash function is a hash function that will give you a lot of different values\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modular Arithmetic\n",
    "\n",
    "* to deal with hash values outside of index range\n",
    "* `h(k) = f(k) % n` where `n` is equal to the table size\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weighted Sum\n",
    "\n",
    "* If our key is the string `\"note\"`, then `n + o + t + e = 78 + 79 + 84 + 69`\n",
    "* However, if our key is `\"tone\"`, then it has the same value as `\"note\"`\n",
    "* Therefore, multiply values at a given index by a certain constant\n",
    "* Still take the modulus at the end\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Universal Hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "* Trying to find a hash function such that you are minimizing the probability of a collision\n",
    "    * So a hash function that satisfies $P(h(x) = h(y)) \\le \\frac{1}{n}$\n",
    "    * $h(x) = [(k \\cdot x + q) \\mod p] \\mod n$ where $k,q$ are random numbers, $p \\ge n$ and is prime"
