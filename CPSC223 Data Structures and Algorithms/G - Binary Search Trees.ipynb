    "* A linked list is a \"linear\" structure, with the data starting on the left and spreading out to the right\n",

    "* We will be looking at **binary search trees** where every node can have *at most* two children.\n",

    "* **leaf node:** nodes that have no children\n",

    "* **internal node:** any node that is not a leaf node\n",
    "    * the internal nodes are 'd', 'b', and 'f'\n",
    "* **forest:** a collection of trees\n",
    "    * you could interpret that 'd' has two trees\n",
    "* **descendant/ancestor nodes:** nodes that have the same familial relationships\n",
    "    * 'a' is a descendant of 'd'\n",
    "    * 'd' is an ancestor of 'a'\n",
    "* **sibling nodes:** nodes that have the same parent\n",
