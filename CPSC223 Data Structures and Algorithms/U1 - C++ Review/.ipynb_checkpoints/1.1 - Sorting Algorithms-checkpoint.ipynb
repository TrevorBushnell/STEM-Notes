The short circuit for this algorithm has to do with the number of swaps that occur. If the algorithm makes one pass and never swaps any two elements, then this means that the elements MUST be in sorted order because the algorithm will only swap elements if they are out of order. As such, you can create a boolean flag variable that checks whether any swaps have occurred. \n",
