    "* We are finding the largest $P(c_i|x)$\n",
    "    * $c_i$ is a class label\n",
    "    * $x$ is an instance\n",
    "* Using Bayes Theorem, we can simplify to $P(c_i|x) = \\frac{P(x|c_i)P(c_i)}{P(x)}$\n",
    "* We can ommit $P(x)$ because this value is constant for all class labels\n",
    "    * The reason this is constant is because it doesn't depend on $c_i$\n",
    "* $P(c_i)$ is your prior, so $\\frac{\\text{number of } c_i \\text{ instances}}{\\text{total \\# of instances}}$ (coming from your training set)\n",
    "    * `get_frequencies()` will help us do this\n",
    "* There are two ways to calculate $P(x|c_i)$\n",
    "    1. without assuming conditional independence $\\implies$ look at all attribute values $v_k$ together PLUS $c_i$\n",
    "        * $P(x|c_i) = \\frac{P(a_1 = v_1 \\cap a_2 = v_2 \\cap \\cdots \\cap a_n = v_n)}{P(c_i)}$ where $\\vec a$ is our attribute values\n",
    "        * restrictive... this will likely be low or zero\n",
    "    2. assuming conditional independence $\\implies$ the effects of an attribute on a class label are independent of other attributes\n",
    "        * $P(x|c_i) = \\prod_{k=1}^n P(v_k | c_i) = P(a_1 = v_1 | c_i) \\cdot P(a_2 = v_2 | c_i) \\cdot ... \\cdot P(a_n = v_n | c_i)$\n",
