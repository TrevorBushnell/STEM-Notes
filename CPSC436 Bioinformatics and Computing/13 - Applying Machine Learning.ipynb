    "* Try running ML diagnostics - test that you run to gain insight into what is/isn't working with a learning algorithm to gain guidance into improving its performance\n",
    "* Evaluating a model - you can have a model that fits the training data well but will fail to generalize to *new* examples not in the training set\n",
    "* Try splitting your data into a training and testing set (should be 70% training and 30% testing) and compute the test and train error\n",
    "  * a more common way to compute test and train error for a classification problem is to see the fraction of the test set and the fraction of the train set that the algorithm has *misclassified*\n",
    "* Training set, dependent set, cross-validation set, test set\n",
    "  * Then your errors are the same formula for each part of the test and you can compare these errors"
