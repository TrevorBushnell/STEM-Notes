# 1.1: SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS

[toc]

## Introduction

* **LINEAR EQUATION:** Equation written in the form $a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \cdots + a_nx_n = b$ 
  * Typically throughout textbook examples, $2 \le n \le 5$ however in real life n could be anywhere between 50 and 500
* **SYSTEM OF LINEAR EQUATIONS (or *linear system*):** collection of 1+ linear equations involving the same variables
  * Instead of using all the letters in the alphabet, will use $x_1, x_2, x_3, \cdots, x_n$ 
* **SOLUTION OF THE SYSTEM:** list of numbers $(s_1, s_2, \cdots, s_n)$ that  makes each equation a true statement when substituted for $x_1, x_2, x_3, \cdots, x_n)$ respectively
* **SOLUTION SET:** The set of all possible solutions to a system of linear equations

> Two linear systems are **equivalent** if they have the same solution set (meaning each solution in system 1 also works for system 2 and vice-versa).

> A system of linear equations has either **one solution** (the lines intersect), **no solutions** (lines are parallel), or **infinitely many solutions** (all equations in the system represent the same line).

> A system of linear equations is said to be **consistent** if it has either *one solution or infinitely many solutions*.
>
>
> A system is considered **inconsistent** if it has *no solution*.



## Matrix Notation

* **MATRIX:** A mathematical "box" or "table" of numbers
  * an $m \times n$ matrix is a matrix that has $m$ rows and $n$ columns
  * Read "an $m$ by $n$ matrix"
* **COEFFICIENT MATRIX (or MATRIX OF COEFFICIENTS):** a matrix where the coefficients of each variable are aligned in the same column
* **AUGMENTED MATRIX:** a coefficient matrix with the last column representing the constants on the right side of each equation in the system



## Solving A Linear System

* To solve a linear system, use the *elementary row operations* to simplify the augmented matrix by eliminating each variables from all the columns except for one
  * use the $x_1$ term in the first equation of a system to eliminate the $x_1$ terms in the other equations, then use the $x_2$ term in the second row to eliminate the $x_2$ terms in the other rows, etc.
  * EX: To get $x_1$ by itself, use the elementary row operations to have a $0$ in every row of the first column of the augmented matrix except for Row 1
  * Best seen in an example to follow soon

> **ELEMENTARY ROW OPERATIONS: **the following operations can be done on any row without changing the solution set of the linear system:
>
> * REPLACEMENT: Replace one row by the sum of itself and a multiple of another row
>   * "add to one row a multiple of another row"
> * INTERCHANGE: Interchange two rows
> * SCALING: Multiply all entries in a row by a nonzero constant
>
>
> NOTE: Row operations are reversible!

> Two matrices are **row equivalent** if there is a sequence of elementary row operations that transforms one matrix into another
>
> If the augmented matrices of two linear systems are row equivalent, then the two systems have the same solution set



## Example: Solving a Linear System Using Matrices

**Solve the following system of equations: ** $\begin{cases}x_1-2x_2+x_3 = 0\\2x_2-8x_3=8\\5x_1-5x_3=10\end{cases}$



To begin, write out the augmented matrix for the system of equations
$$
\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
1&-2&1&0\\
0&2&-8&8\\
5&0&-5&10
\end{array}
\right]
$$


Next, use the $x_1$ in the first row to eliminate the $x_1$ variables in the other rows by adding -5 times Row 1 to Row 3:
$$
\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
1&-2&1&0\\
0&2&-8&8\\
5+(-5)(1)&0+(-5)(-2)&-5+(-5)(1)&10+(-5)(0)
\end{array}
\right]
=
\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
1&-2&1&0\\
0&2&-8&8\\
0&10&-10&10
\end{array}
\right]
$$


Next, multiply Row 2 by 0.5 and Row 3 by -0.1 to make future calculations simpler:
$$
\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
1&-2&1&0\\
0*0.5&2*0.5&-8*0.5&8*0.5\\
0*-0.1&10*-0.1&-10*-0.1&10*-0.1
\end{array}
\right]
=
\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
1&-2&1&0\\
0&1&-4&4\\
0&-1&1&-1
\end{array}
\right]
$$


Now, use the $x_2$ in Row 2 to eliminate $x_2$ from Rows 1 and 3 by adding 2 times Row 2 to Row 1 and Adding Row 2 to Row 3:
$$
\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
1+(2)(0)&-2+(2)(1)&1+(2)(-4)&0+(2)(4)\\
0&1&-4&4\\
0+0&-1+1&1+(-4)&-1+4
\end{array}
\right]
=
\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
1&0&-7&8\\
0&1&-4&4\\
0&0&-3&3
\end{array}
\right]
$$


Further simplify by dividing Row 3 by -3:
$$
\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
1&0&-7&8\\
0&1&-4&4\\
0\div-3&0\div-3&-3\div-3&3\div-3
\end{array}
\right]
=
\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
1&0&-7&8\\
0&1&-4&4\\
0&0&1&-1
\end{array}
\right]
$$


Finally use the $x_3$ in Row 3 to eliminate $x_3$ from Rows 1 and 2 by adding 7 times Row 3 to Row 1 and 4 times Row 3 to Row 2:
$$
\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
1+(7)(0)&0+(7)(0)&-7+(7)(1)&8+(7)(-1)\\
0+(4)(0)&1+(4)(0)&-4+(4)(1)&4+(4)(-1)\\
0&0&1&-1
\end{array}
\right]
=
\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
1&0&0&1\\
0&1&0&0\\
0&0&1&-1
\end{array}
\right]
$$


The resulting matrix from above tells us that $x_1 = 1, x_2 = 0, \text{ and } x_3 = -1$. 



You can check that this solution works by substituting back into the original equations:
$$
\begin{align}
1(1) - 2(0)+1(-1) =& 1 - 0 - 1 = 0\\
2(0)-8(-1)=&0+8=8\\
5(1)-5(-1)=&5+5=10

\end{align}
$$


Since the equations still hold true, $(1,0,-1)$ is the solution to the linear system. 





## Existence and Uniqueness Questions

* To determine which possibility is true, ask the following questions:
  * Is the system consistent- does at least one solution exist?
  * If a solution exists, is it the *only* one- is the solution *unique*?
* The questions will pop up often throughout the course
* In the example worked out previously, the system is *consistent* because it had a solution and it was *unique* because it had only one solution
* If when working out your solution to a linear system you stumble across a false claim (ex: $15 = 0$), then the linear system must be inconsistent



## Numerical Note

* These types of problems are often solved by computer algorithms when these types of problems need to be solved in the real world
* These programs use *floating point arithmetic* which mean that the program represents numbers as decimals up to between 8 and 16 digits long
* These results are typically inexact because the result might be truncated to the number of digits possible to be stored
* Another error with using floating point arithmetic is "roundoff error" which is where a number such as $\frac{1}{3}$ cannot be stored correctly since the computer must store an infinite number with a finite number of digits
* Inaccuracies due to floating point arithmetic seldom cause problems in the real world
