\section{The Basics of Counting}

\begin{definition}[The Product Rule]{def5.1:label}
    Suppose that a prodecure can be broken down into a sequence of two tasks (task 1 then task 2). If there are $n_1$ ways to do the first task and $n_2$ ways to do the second task following the first task, then tehre are $n_1\cdot n_2$ ways to do the procedure.
\end{definition}

\begin{problem}
    a) How many two letter strings can be made from the letters from the set $S \{A,B,C\}$?\\

    \begin{itemize}
        \item $AA,AB,AC$
        \item $BA,BB,BC$
        \item $CA,CB,CC$
    \end{itemize}

    Therefore there are a total of 9 ways that two letter strings can be made from the elements of the set $S$. Notice how the first choice was counting the "rows" and the second choice was counting the "columns."\\

    b) What happens if the letters cannot be repeated?

    \begin{itemize}
        \item $AB,AC$
        \item $BA,BC$
        \item $CA,CB$
    \end{itemize}

    Therefore there are a total of 6 ways that two letter strings without letter repeats can be made from the elements of the set $S$. Notice again how the first choice was counting the "rows" and the second choice was counting the "columns."
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
    A multiple choice exam contains 10 questions. There are four possible answers for each question.\\

\begin{definition}[The Sum Rule]{def5.2:label}
    Suppose that there are $n_1$ ways to do task 1 and $n_2$ ways to do task 2. If thereis no overlap between the two tassk, then there are $n_1+n_2$ ways to do either task 1 OR task 2 (this means that task 1 and task 2 must be independent of each other).
\end{definition}

\begin{problem}

    \textbf{How many bit strings are there of length 4 or less?:} $2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4$\\

    $$
\end{problem}


\begin{definition}[Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion]{def5.3:label}
    Suppose that there are $n_1$ ways to do task 1 and $n_2$ ways to do task 2, and $k$ ways to do both. Then there are $n_1+n_2-k$ ways to do task 1 or task 2.
\end{definition}

\begin{problem}

        \item Are divisble by both 3 and 5? \textbf{6}
        \item Are divisible by either 3 or 5? $19+33-6$ = \textbf{46}
        \item Are divisble by excactly one of 3 and 5? $46-6$ = \textbf{40}
        \item Are divisible by neither 3 nor 5? $100 - 46$ = \textbf{53}
        \item Are divisible by 3, but not 5? $33-6$ = \textbf{27}
    \end{itemize}
\end{problem}



\section{The Pigeonhole Principle}

\begin{definition}[The Pigeonhole Principle]{def5.2.1:label}

\end{definition}

\begin{problem}

    \textbf{BOXES:} the months of the year
    \textbf{OBJECTS:} the people that are in the room
\end{problem}


\begin{definition}[The GENERALIZED Pigeonhole Principle]{def5.2.2:label}

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{def6.3:label}

    \end{itemize}
\end{problem}


\begin{theorem}{theorem5.3:label}
    If $n$ is a positive integer and $r$ is an integer between 1 and $n$ (inclusive), then there are:

    $$
    P(n,r) = n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots(n-r+1) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}
    $$

    $r$-permutations of a set with $n$ distinct elements.
\end{theorem}


\textbf{NOTE:} There are some following unique applications of this theorem to keep in mind:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $P(n,0) = 1$ which corresponds to "one way to order zero elements"
    \item $P(n,n) = n!$ which corresponds to "$n!$ was to order $n$ elements"
\end{itemize}

        \item In how many ways can Gold, Silver, and Bronze be awarded assuming no ties? $P(8,3) = frac{8!}{5!}=8\cdot 7\cdot 6$

    \end{itemize}
\end{problem}


\begin{definition}{def5.3.2:label}
