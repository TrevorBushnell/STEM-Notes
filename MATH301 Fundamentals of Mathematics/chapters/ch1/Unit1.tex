\section{Sets}

\begin{definition}[Sets and Elements]{def1.1:label}
    A \textbf{set} is a collection of \textit{elements}.\\

    $A = C$ means that the sets $A$ and $C$ both have the same elements (doesn't mean that the elements are in the same order).\\

    Examples of sets include the following:

    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{aligned}
            &\{1,2,3,4,5\}\\
            &\{A,B,C,D,E,F\}
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation*}

    Elements don't have to be numerical, they can be letters, words, phrases, numbers, etc.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Cardinality]{def1.1.2:label}
    The \textbf{cardinality} of a finite set is the number of elements in the set, denoted $|A|$. \\

    For example, for the set $A = \{1,2,3\}$, the cardinality of the set is $3$ because there are three elements in the set.
\end{definition}


\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{empty set} ($\varnothing$) is the set that contains no elements (so $\varnothing = \{\}$)
    \item A lot of time when we are writing in sets, we prefer to write in \textbf{set builder notation}, which means that inside the brackets we write the types of elements that are in the set, and then define a rule which the elements in the set follow
    \begin{itemize}
        \item EXAMPLE: $\{x : x \ge 2\}$ means the set containing any numerical element such that the element is greater than or equal to 2.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}\newpage


\section{The Cartesian Product}

\begin{definition}[Ordered Pairs]{def1.2.1:label}
    An \textbf{ordered pair} is a list $(x,y)$ of two elements $x$ and $y$, enclosed in parenthases and separated by a comma. 
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}[Cartesian Product]{def1.2.2:label}
    The \textbf{Cartesian product} of two sets $A$ ad $B$ is the set $A \times B$ or all ordered pairs with the first element from $A$ and the second element from $B$. \\

    $$
    A \times B = \{(a,b) : a \in A \:\&\: b \in B\}
    $$
\end{definition}


\begin{problem}
    Find the cross product of the sets $A = \{1,2,3\}$ and $B = \{c,d\}$.

    $$
    A \times B = \{(1,c), (1,d),(2,c), (2,d),(3,c), (3,d)\}
    $$
\end{problem}
