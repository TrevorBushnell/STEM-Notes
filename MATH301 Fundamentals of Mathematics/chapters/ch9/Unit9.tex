\begin{itemize}
    \item Induction is like climbing an infinite ladder
    \item \textbf{GOAL:} Prove that $P(n)$ is true for all $n\in\N$
    \begin{itemize}
        \item NOTE: Starting at 0 isn't anything special, we can start anywhere and move upwards from there

\section{Outline for Proof By Induction}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that $P(0)$ is true
    \item Show that for any $k \ge 0$, $P(k) \implies P(k+1)$
    \item Then for any $n\in\N$, we know $P(0) \implies P(1) \implies P(2) \implies \cdots \implies P(n)$. Since we know $P(0)$ is true, then $P(n)$ must also be true
\end{enumerate}

\section{Proof by Induction Examples}

\begin{proposition}{prop9.2.1:label}
    If $n\in\Z^+$, then $1+3+5+7+...+(2n-1)=n^2$
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
    Suppose $n=1$. Then $1=1^2$ which is a true statement. \\

    Now suppose that for some $k\in\Z^+$ that $1+3+5+7+...+(2k-1) = k^2$. Then, 
    \[
    \begin{aligned}
        1+3+5+7+...+(2k-1)+(2(k+1)-1) &= k^2 + (2(k+1)-1)\\
        &= k^2 + 2k + 2 - 1\\
        &= k^2+2k+1\\
        &= (k+1)^2
    \end{aligned}    
    \]
    
    Therefore, by induction, we know that for all $n\in\Z^+$, we have $1+3+...+(2n-1)=n^2$.
\end{proof}

\newpage
\begin{proposition}{prop9.2.2:label}
    If $n\in\N$, then $5|n^5-n$.
\end{proposition}


\begin{proof}
    Suppose that $n=0$. Then $(0)^5 - 0 = 0$ and $5|0$. \\

    Now suppose that $k \in\N$ such that $5|k^5-k$. 

    Then, 

    \[
    \begin{aligned}
        &(k+1)^5 - (k+1)\\
        &k^5+5k^4+10k^3+10k^2+5k+1-k-1\\
        &(k^5-k) + 5k^4+10k^3+10k^2+5k
    \end{aligned}    
    \]

    We already know that $(k^5-k)$ is divisble by 5. Since we can factor out a 5 from $5k^4+10k^3+10k^2+5k$, we also know that $5k^4+10k^3+10k^2+5k$ is divisible by 5. Since two multiples of 5 added together are still divible by 5, we know that $5|(k+1)^5 - (k+1)$. Therefore, by proof by induction, we know that for all $n\in\N$, $5|n^5-n$.
\end{proof}
