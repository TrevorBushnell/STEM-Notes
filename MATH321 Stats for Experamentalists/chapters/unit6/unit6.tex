\section{Continuous Uniform Random Variable}

\begin{itemize}
    \item used to model behavior of a random vairable whose values are uniformily/evenly distributed
    \item pdf for this random variable is $f(x) = \frac{1}{b-a}; \:a \le x \le b$
    \item the graph of this is just simply a rectangle
    \item probability can be calculated as the area under the rectangle over that area
    \item MEAN: $\mu = \frac{b+a}{2}$
    \item VARIANCE: $\sigma^2 = \frac{(b-a)^2}{12}$
\end{itemize}
