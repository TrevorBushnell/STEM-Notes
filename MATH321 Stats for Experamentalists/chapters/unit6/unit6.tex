\section{Continuous Uniform Random Variable}

\begin{itemize}
    \item used to model behavior of a random vairable whose values are uniformily/evenly distributed
    \item pdf for this random variable is $f(x) = \frac{1}{b-a}; \:a \le x \le b$
    \item the graph of this is just simply a rectangle
    \item probability can be calculated as the area under the rectangle over that area
    \item MEAN: $\mu = \frac{b+a}{2}$
    \item VARIANCE: $\sigma^2 = \frac{(b-a)^2}{12}$
\end{itemize}

\section{Normal Probability Distribution}

Lots of random variables in the real world follow a sort of mound-shaped distribution, which we call a \bf{normal probability distribution}. 

\begin{definition}[The Normal Probability Distribution]{def5.a:label}
    The \bf{Normal probability distribution} follows the following pdf:

    $$
    f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{\frac{-(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}, \:\: -\infty < x < \infty
    $$

    Where $\pi, e$ are the traditional mathematical constants, $\mu$ is the population mean and $\sigma$ is the population standard deviation.
\end{definition}

\begin{itemize}
    \item In a Normal distribution, $\mu$ is the center of the graph and $\sigma$ determines the shape of the graph (smaller $\sigma$ means a more narrow mound-shaped graph, while a larger $\sigma$ means a more spread out/flatter mound-shaped graph)
    \item The distribution is \it{symmetric} about $\mu$ which means half the area is below $\mu$ and half the area is above $\mu$. 
\end{itemize}


\section{Standard Normal Random Variable}

We can \bf{standardize} a value $x$ as the number of standard deviations $\sigma$ it lies from the mean $\mu$. \\

The \bf{standardized Normal random variable} $z$ is defined as:

$$
    \begin{aligned}
        z &= \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\\
        x &= \mu + z\sigma
    \end{aligned}
$$

This is the same as the z-score used earlier in the course to determine outliers. We can notice the following patterns

\begin{itemize}
    \item If $x < \mu$, then $z < 0$
    \item If $x > \mu$, then $z < 0$
    \item If $x = \mu$, then $z=0$
\end{itemize}

The area under the standard normal curve to the left of a specific value of $z$ - say $b$ - is the probability $P(z \le b)$.\\

Likewise, the area under the standard normal curve to the right of a specific value of $z$ - say $b$ - is the probability $P(z \ge b) = 1 - P(z < b)$\\

Finally, the area between two possible values of $z$ - say $a$ and $b$ - is probability $P(a \le z \le b) = P(z \le b) - P(z \le a)$
