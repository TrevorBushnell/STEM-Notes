# 1.2 ROW REDUCTION AND ECHELON FORMS

[toc]

## Introduction and Definition of Echelon Form

* This lesson is all about creating an algorithm based on the method from 1.1
* First part of the question will allow us to address the fundamental existence and uniqueness questions
* Algorithm will apply to any matrix
* **NONZERO ROW OR COLUMN:** A row or column that contains at least one nonzero entry
* **LEADING ENTRY OF A ROW:** The leftmost nonzero entry (in a nonzero row)



### Echelon Form

> A rectangular matrix is in **echelon form** (or **row echelon form**) if it has the following three properties:
>
> * All nonzero rows are above any rows of all zeros
> * Each leading entry of a row is in a column to the right of the leading entry of the row above it
>   * Leading entries form a step-like pattern that moves down and to the right through the matrix
> * All entries in a column below a leading entry are zeros
>
>
> If a matrix in echelon form satisfies the following additional conditions, then it is in **reduced echelon form** (or **reduced row echelon form**):
>
> * The leading entry in each nonzero row is 1
> * Each leading 1 is the only nonzero entry in its column
>
>
> An **echelon matrix** or **reduced echelon matrix** is a matrix that is in echelon form or reduced echelon form, respectively.

* EX: A matrix in echelon form [$\cdot$ means leading entry w/ nonzero value, * may have any value (including zero)]
  $$
  \left[
  \begin{array}{cccc}
  \cdot & * & * & *\\
  0 & \cdot & * & *\\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 0
  \end{array}
  \right]
  $$
  
 * EX: A matrix in reduced echelon form
   $$
   \left[
   \begin{array}{cccc}
   1&0&*&*\\
   0&1&*&*\\
   0&0&0&0\\
   0&0&0&0
   \end{array}
   \right]
   $$



> **THEOREM 1: UNIQUENESS OF THE REDUCED ECHELON FORM:** Each matrix is row equivalent to one and only one reduced echelon matrix.





## Pivot Positions

* The leading entries are always in the same positions in any echelon form obtained from a given matrix

> A **pivot position** in a matrix $A$ is a location in $A$ that corresponds to a leading 1 in the reduced echelon form of $A$. A **pivot column** is a column of $A$ that contains a pivot position.

* From the examples above, the dots represent the pivot positions





## The Row Reduction Algorithm

* (1) Begin with the leftmost nonzero column, which is a pivot column. The pivot position is at the top.
* (2) Select a nonzero entry in the pivot column as a pivot. If necessary, interchange rows to move this entry into the pivot position.
* (3) Use row replacement operations to create zeros in all positions below the pivot
* (4) Cover (or ignore) the row containing the pivot position and cover all rows, if any, above it. Apply steps 1-3 to the submatrix that remains. Repeat the process until there are no more nonzero rows to modify.
* (5) Begin with the rightmost pivot and working upward and to the left, create zeros above each pivot. If a pivot is not 1, make it 1 by a scaling operation.
* Steps (1)-(4) are called the **forward phase**
* Step (5) is called the **backwards phase**
  * **NUMERICAL NOTE:** In step (2), a computer program usually selects as a pivot the entry in a column having the largest absolute value
    * Called *partial pivoting* and is useful because it reduces roundoff errors 





## Solutions of Linear Systems

* variables in corresponding pivot columns are called *basic variables*
* other variables NOT in corresponding pivot columns are called **free variables**

* when a system is consistent, the solution set can be described explicitly by solving the reduced system of equations for the basic variables in terms of the free variables
  * $x_n \text{ is free}$ means that you are free to choose any value for $x_n$





## Parametric Descriptions of Solutions Sets

* You can define a solution set parametrically by having the free variables be the parameters
* *Solving a system* then amounts to finding a parametric description of the solution set or determining that the solution set is empty
* If a system is inconsistent, the solution set is empty, even if there are free variables present
  * This means that there is no parametric representation





## Back Substitution

* Back-substitution is where you solve for one variable in terms of another variable then replace it in all the other equations in the system until you know the value of one of the variables
* Back-substitution has the same number of operations as row reducing a matrix, but **back-substitution is more prone to errors than row reducing a matrix**
* **BEST STRATEGY: Always use the *reduced* echelon form to solve a linear system!**



### Numerical Notes

* Algorithms for solving systems are measured in flops (floating point operations)
* **flop:** one arithmetic operation ($+, -, \times, /$) on two real floating point numbers
* For an $n \times (n+1)$ matrix, the reduction to echelon form can take $\frac{2n^3}{3}+\frac{n^2}{2}-\frac{7n}{6}$ (or just $\frac{2n^3}{3}$ if $n \ge 30$)
* CONTRAST: Further reduced to reduced echelon form needs at most $n^2$ flops





## Existence and Uniqueness

> **EXISTENCE AND UNIQUENESS THEOREM**
>
>
> A linear system is consistent IFF the rightmost column of the augmented matrix is *not* a pivot column$-$ that is, IFF an echelon form of the augmented matrix has *no* row of the form:
> $$
> [0 \:\cdots \:0 \: \: \:b] \:\:\:\:\: \text{with } b \text{ nonzero}
> $$
> If a linear system is consistent, then the solution set contains either:
>
> * a unique solution (when there are no free variables)
> * infinitely many solutions (when there is at least one free variable)



### Using Row Reduction to Solve a Linear System

* (1) Write the augmented matrix of the system
* (2) Use row reduction algorithm to obtain an equivalent augmented matrix in echelon form. Decide whether the system is consistent. If there is no solution, stop; otherwise go to the next step
* (3) Continue row reduction to obtain the reduced echelon form
* (4) Write the system of equations corresponding to the matrix obtained in step 3
* (5) Rewrite each nonzero equation from Step 4 so that its one basic variable is expressed in terms of any free variables appearing in the equation
