# 4.1: Vector Spaces and Subspaces

## Definition of a Vector Space

> A **vector spaces** is a nonempty set $V$ of objects called *vectors* on which are defined two operations: ADDITION and SCALAR MULTIPLICATION that are subject to the ten axioms (or rules) listed below. The axioms must hold true for all vectors $\vec u$, $\vec v$, and $\vec w$ in $V$ and for all scalars $c$ and $d$. 
>
> 
>
> * $\vec u + \vec v $ $\in$ $V$ 
> * $\vec u + \vec v = \vec v + \vec u$
> * $(\vec u + \vec v) + \vec w = \vec u + (\vec v + \vec w)$
> * There is a zero vector $\vec 0$ in $V$ such that $\vec u + \vec 0$ = $\vec u$ 
> * For each $\vec u$ in $V$, there is a vector $-\vec u$ in $V$ such that $\vec u + (-\vec u$) = $\vec 0$
> * $c\vec u \in V$
> * $c(\vec u + \vec v) = c\vec u + c\vec v$
> * $(c + d) \vec u = c\vec d + d\vec u$
> * $c(d\vec u) = (cd)\vec u$
> * $1\vec u = u$



* To prove that something is a vector space, prove that each of the 10 axioms listed in the vector space definition hold true



## Definition of a Vector Subspace

> A **subspace** of a vector space $V$ is a subset $H$ of $V$ that has three properties:
>
> 
>
> * The zero vector of $V$ is in $H$
> * for each $\vec u \in H$ and each $\vec v \in H$, then $\vec u + \vec v \in H$
> * for each $\vec u \in H$ and each $c \in \R$, then $c\vec u \in H$



* By using the properties under the definition of a subspace, $H$ then must be a vector space as well
  * Each of the subspace properties are axioms 1, 4, 6
  * Axioms 2, 3, 7-10 are automatically true they apply to all the elements in $V$, including $H$ because $H \in V$
* the set consisting of only the zero vector in a vector space $V$ is a subspace of $V$ called the **zero subspace** and written as {$\vec 0$}



## A Subspace Spanned By a Set

* If $\vec v_1, \cdots, \vec v_p$ are in a vector space $V$, then span{$\vec v_1, \cdots, \vec v_p$} which is also called the **subspace spanned (or generated)** by {$\vec v_1, \cdots, \vec v_p$}
* Given any subspace $H$ of $V$, a **spanning (or generating**) **set** for $H$ is a set {$\vec v_1, \cdots, \vec v_p$}
* If you can show that $H$ has the form of a linear combination and the vectors that make the linear combination are linearly independent, then $H$ is automatically a subspace of the vector space $V$
