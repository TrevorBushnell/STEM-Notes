# 4.2: Null Space, Column Space, and Linear Transformations

[toc]

## Introduction

* In LA applications, subspaces of $\R^n$ usually arise in one of these two ways:
  * as the set of all solutions to a system of homogeneous linear equations
  * as the set of all linear combinations of certain specified vectors
* This section will address applications of subspaces in these two ways



## The Null Space of a Matrix

> The **null space** of an $m \times n$ matrix $A$, written as $\text{Nul } A$, is the set of all solutions of the homogeneous equation $A\vec x = \vec 0$. In set notation:
> $$
> \text{Nul } A = \{\vec x: \vec x \text{ is in }\R ^n \text{ and } A\vec x = \vec 0\}
> $$

* DYNAMIC DESCRIPTION: the set of all $\vec x$ that are mapped to the zero vector of $\R^n$ that are mapped into the zero vector of $\R^m$ via the linear transformation $\vec x$ $\to$ $A\vec x$



> **THEOREM:** the null space of an $m \times n $ matrix $A$ is a subspace of $\R^n$. Equivalently, the set of all solutions to a system $A\vec x = \vec 0$ of $m$ homogeneous linear equations in $n$ unknowns is a subspace of $\R^n$ 

* The equations HAVE to be homogeneous, otherwise the set of solutions will definitely *not* be a subspace because the zero vector is not a solution of a nonhomogeneous system)



## An Explicit Description of $\text{Nul } A$

* $\text{Nul } A$ is defined implicitly because there is a condition that must be checked
* **Solving the equation $A\vec x = \vec 0$ amounts to producing an *explicit* description of $\text{ Nul } A$ **
* The spanning set produced by row reducing [$A \:\:\:\: \vec 0$] to reduced echelon form is automatically linearly independent because the free variables are the weights on the spanning vectors
* When $\text{Nul } A$ contains nonzero vectors, the number of vectors in the spanning set for $\text{Nul } A$ equals the number of free variables in the equation $A\vec x = \vec 0$
