    "An algorithm should have these following properties for it to be considered a good solution algorithm:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "* **Accuracy:** how small is the expected error of this algorithm?\r\n",
    "* **Efficiency:** how long does it take for the algorithm to run?\r\n",
    "    * *rate of convergence:* how many iterations does it take to get a good result?\r\n",
    "    * *operation count (FLOP count):* how many +,-,*,/ operations does the algorithm make?\r\n",
    "* **Robustness:** how reliable is the algorithm? Can the algorithm fail? When will it fail?\r\n",
    "    * *stability:* an algorithm is stabe if small changes to input data lead to only small changes to the solution\r\n",
    "    * we hope that the problem statement is *well-conditioned*. This means that the problem statement is written in such a way that small changes to input data lead to only small changes in the solution"
