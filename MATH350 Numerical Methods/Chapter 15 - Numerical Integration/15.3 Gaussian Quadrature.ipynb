    "A basic quadrature method on $[a,b]$ has the form $\\int_a^b f(x)\\:dx \\approx \\sum_{j=0}^n a_jf(x_j)$. However, until now we have used equally-spaced abscissae. In Gaussian Quadrature, we can choose the abscissae cleverly so that if $f$ is any polynomial of degree $\\le n$, then $\\int_a^b f(x)\\:dx = \\sum_{j=0}^n a_jf(x_j)$. \n",
