    "Assume that the columns of $A$ are linearly independent (so $A$ has full column rank, $\\text{rank}(A) = n$). Usually, we can't find a solution $\\vec x$ that works exactly, so we hope to minimize $||\\vec r|| = ||\\vec b - A \\vec x||$. As such, we are actually solving $\\min_{\\vec x}||\\vec b - A \\vec x||$. For convenience, we square the norm (which in turns cleans the square root) and multiply by $\\frac{1}{2}$ (gets rid of some constants later). This means that we want to find the absolute minimum of the function $\\Psi(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) = \\Psi(\\vec x) = \\frac{1}{2}||\\vec b - A \\vec x||^2$. This means that we need to find $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_n} \\vec x = 0$ for each component. Let's do some simplifying (NOTE: Calc III content coming in!!!!)\n",
