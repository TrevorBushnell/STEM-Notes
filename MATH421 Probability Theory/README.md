# MATH421: Probability Theory NOTES

This is here to explain what is going on in this directory:

Right now I'm preferring taking my notes for this class by hannd. However, we are writing/running some R code and I wanted a place to save all of this R code that we go over in class. As such, this repo contains Jupyter notebooks with runnable R code (assuming you have an R kernel) going over some of the code that is written in class.

I will (potentially) come back later and put my notes back in LaTeX but that's not a project that I am concerned about right now. For now, just enjoy these R notebooks!
