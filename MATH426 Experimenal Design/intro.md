# FIRST LECTURE

## Introduction

* Design of experiments (DOE) stats method for investigating input/output to identify
* Inputs are $x$ and the outputs are $y$
* There are 5 activities linked to this:
    * Prepare design
    * collection
    * stats analysis
    * design
    * conclusion
* Understaing DOE helps achieve more statistically optimal results from experiments or improve output quality
* Using DOE, you can learn **individual and interactive effects** that can influence output results

## General Model of a Process

* in general, experiments are used to study the performance of precesses and systems
* In our case, you have controllable and uncontrollable factors that we have to manage to map our inputs into outputs

## Objective of the Experiment

1. Determine which variables are most influential on response $y$
2. Dertermine where 

## 3 Principles of Design
* **replication:** independent repeat which lets us estimate the *experimental error*
    * **more replication $\to$ more precise inference**
* **randomization:** randomize our data and our variables that we can control. statistical methods require assumptions on randomization which means we will have all of our statistical tools at our disposal
* **blocking:** technique to include other factors in our experiment which contribute to undesirable variation
    * most of this class is how to effectively use blocking
    * a block is a set of relatively homogeneous experimental conditions


## Random Variables and Probability Distribution

* discrete random variable: random varaible with finite possible values, probability mass function comes from summing probabilities in individual values and they all add to 1
* continuous random variable: possible values form an interval, probability density function comes from integration, and the integral over the entire interval is 1


## Mean and Variance

* Mean $\mu=E(Y)$ is the center, location, etc
* variance $\sigma^2 = Var(Y)$ is spread and dispersion
