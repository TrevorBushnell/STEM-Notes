# MATH455: Chaos and Dynamical Systems

This is where I will write all my notes for this class. I will be doing this entire class in Julia and write my assignments/code in Jupyter notebooks. To get a Julia kernel for Jupyter notebooks, start with the following:

1. Install Julia with `curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh`
    * If you are a Windows user, install Julia instead with `winget install julia -s msstore`
2. Open the Julia REPL in the command-line using the `julia` command.
3. Run `using Pkg`
4. Run `Pkg.add("IJulia")`
5. Create a new notebook and choose Julia from the kernel option in your notebooks. If done correctly, this should work in any IDE that opens Jupyter notebooks.
