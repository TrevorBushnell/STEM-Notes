\section{Units and Unit Conversions}

\begin{itemize}
	\item In order to effectively understand the physical world around us and be able to make comparisons between physical situations, we need to be able to quanitify different physical situations
	\item There are many different ways that we can quantify the same unit of measure, and as such it is important to know how to convert between these different measurement types 
	\item To convert between different units, find a relationship between the two units you wish to convert and express them as a 1-to-1 ratio. If you multiply this ratio by the measurement you wish to convert, you are effectively multiplying by one (it is a 1-to-1 ratio afterall) and therefore you are not changing the value of the expression
	\item To find relationships between different units, feel free to use Google (however it is encouraged to see if you can commit some of these relationships to memory as the class progresses)
\end{itemize}

\section{EXAMPLES: Unit Conversions}

The following are some examples of how to convert different units of measurement. Some of these units are completely arbitrary and are simply used to show the process for converting between different units of measurement.

\begin{problem}	
	Convert $70 \frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}}$ to $\frac{\text{meters}}{\text{second}}$
 
	$$
	\frac{70\text{ miles}}{\text{hour}}\cdot\frac{1.609 \text{ km}}{1 \text{ mile}}\cdot\frac{1 \text{ hr}}{3600 \text{ sec}}\cdot\frac{1000 \text{ m}}{1 \text{ km}} \approx 31.286 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}
	$$
\end{problem}\newpage

\begin{problem}
	A 'gry' is $\frac{1}{10}$ of a line which is $\frac{1}{12}$ of an inch. A common length in publishing is a 'point' which is $\frac{1}{72}$ of an inch. Convert $0.5\text{ grys}^2$ to $\text{points}^2$.

	$$
	\frac{0.5\text{ grys}^2}{1}\cdot\frac{(0.1\text{ lines})^2}{(1
	\text{ gry})^2}\cdot\frac{(\frac{1}{12}\text{ inches})^2}{(1\text{ line})^2}\cdot\frac{(1\text point)^2}{(\frac{1}{72}\text{ inches})^2} = 0.18\text{ points}^2
	$$
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
	A lake has 120 acres of water and is 20 feet deep. How many kiloliters of water are in the lake?\\

	\textit{Begin by first computing the volume of the lake using the units given:}

	$$
	V = (120\text{ acres}) \cdot (20\text{ ft}) = 2400 \text{ acres}\cdot\text{ft}
	$$

	\textit{Now we can convert the volume to kiloliters:}
	$$
	\begin{aligned}
		&\frac{2400\text{ acres}\cdot\text{ft}}{1}\cdot\frac{(1.609\text{ km})^2}{(1\text{ mi})^2}\cdot\frac{1\text{ mi}^2}{640\text{ acres}}\cdot\frac{1\text{ m}}{3.28\text{ ft}}\cdot\frac{1\text{ km}}{1000\text{ m}} = 0.00296\text{ km}^3\\
		&\frac{0.00296\text{ km}^3}{1}\cdot\frac{1\text{ mL}}{1 \text{cm}^3}\cdot\frac{1\text{ L}}{1000\text{ mL}}\cdot\frac{(1000\text{ m})^3}{(1\text{ km})^3}\cdot\frac{(100\text{ cm})^3}{(1\text{ m})^3}\cdot\frac{1\text{kL}}{1000\text{L}} = 2.96 \times 10^6 \text{kL}
	\end{aligned}
	$$
