    $$

    $W$ = Work done (SI Units: $\J = \N\m$)\\
    $\Delta E$ = Change in energy\\

\section{Energy}

Energy comes in many different forms. The main forms of energy (as well as the proofs to get their respective equations) are listed below:


\begin{definition}[Kinetic Energy]{def4.2:label}
    If an object is moving, the energy that the object expends is equal to the \textbf{kinetic energy}. 

    $$
    KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
    $$

    $KE$ = the kinetic energy expended\\
    $m$ = mass of the object\\
    $v$ = velocity of the object at the given moment where you wish to find the energy
\end{definition}

\textbf{NOTE:} Energy is \textit{positive} if energy is being stored and \textit{negative} if energy is being released.

    While this problem could be solved using kinematics and Newton's second law, we can also use the Work-Energy theorem. 

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        W_{in} &= \Delta KE + \Delta PE\\
        F_T \cdot L &= \frac{1}{2}m(v_f - v_i)^2 + mg(h_f - h_i)\\

\section{Work and Calculus}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Sometimes, the force being applied to an object over a given distance is variable
    \item If you are given an equation for what the force is (dependent on distance), then $W = \int_{x_i}^{x_f} F(x) dx$
\end{itemize}


\begin{problem}
    If the force applied to an object (as a function of distance) is $F(x) = 5 - 2x$, what is the work done on the object if the object moves 3 \m?

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        W &= \int_{x_i}^{x_f} F(x) \: dx\\
        W &= \int_{0}^{3} 5-2x \: dx\\
        W &= (5-2(3))-(5-2(0)) = -1-5

\section{Power}

\begin{definition}[Power]{def4.5:label}
    \textbf{Power:} How much energy is expended over a given time interval.

    $$
    P = \frac{\Delta E}{\Delta t} = \frac{W}{t}
    $$

    \textbf{SI Units:} Watts (W)
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}[Instantaneous Power]{def4.6:label}
    If power is rewritten as a function of time $P(t)$, then:

    $$
    E = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} P(t)dt 
    $$

    Likewise, if you want to find the instantaneous power, then:

    $$
    P(t) = \frac{dE}{dt}
    $$

\begin{problem}
    A truck drives up a ramp with an angle of inclination of $15^\circ$. If the truck drives 200 meters in 20 seconds, what is the power of the truck (in kW) after the truck has moved 200 meters? Assume that 10\% of the total energy is lost to the environment.

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        P &= \frac{\Delta E}{t}\\
        P &= \frac{\Delta KE + \Delta PE}{t}+ 10\%\text{ energy}\\
        P &= \frac{\frac{1}{2}mv^2 + mgh}{t} + 10\%\text{ energy}\\
        P &= \left[\frac{\frac{1}{2}m\left(\frac{\Delta x}{t}\right)^2 + mgL\sin\theta}{t}\right]\frac{1}{0.9}\\

\begin{problem}
    A person with mass 80 kg is on a scooter on top of a hill that is 30 m tall. The person is pushed off by a spring with a spring coefficient of 1500 N/m. The spring is compressed 2.5 m. The person will then go down a hill and launch into the air, then land in a pit of tar with a coefficient of kinetic friction of 0.8. \\

    a) Find the velocity of the person right after the spring pushes him off.\\

    b) Find the distance the person will travel after he lands in the tar.

    a)

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        W &= \Delta KE + \Delta E_s\\
        0 &= \frac{1}{2}mv_i^2+\frac{1}{2}k(-x_i)^2\\
        v_i = \sqrt{\frac{kx_i^2}{m}}\\
        v_i = 10.8 \frac{\m}{\s}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    b)
    $$
    \begin{aligned}

        0 &= -\frac{1}{2}mv_i^2 + - mgh_i + \mu_kF_Nd\\
        d &= \frac{mgh_i + \frac{1}{2}mv_i^2}{\mu_kmg}\\

\end{problem}


\begin{problem}
    A ball with mass 2 kg is placed inside a cannon that is launched using a spring with spring constant 200 N/m. The spring is compressed 2 m and is compressed all the way to the ground (so that $PE_i = 0$). The cannon is at an angle of $20^\circ$. What is the maximum height that the ball is launched?

    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{chapters/ch4/images/fig4_11.PNG}
    \end{center}

    We first need the velocity right when the ball leaves the spring. We can set up a mini Work-Energy problem:
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        W &= \Delta KE + \Delta PE + \Delta E_s\\
        0 &= \frac{1}{2}mv_i^2 + mgL\sin\theta + \frac{1}{2}k(-(L^2))\\
        \frac{1}{2}mv_i^2 &= \frac{1}{2}kL^2 - mgl\sin\theta\\
        v_i &= \sqrt{\frac{2\left(\frac{1}{2}kL^2 - mgl\sin\theta\right)}{m}}
    \end{aligned}
    $$


    Now we can use the x-component of that velocity to get the final velocity in the overall Work-Energy problem.
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        W &= \Delta KE + \Delta PE + \Delta E_s\\
        0 &= \frac{1}{2}mv_x^2 + mgh_f + \frac{1}{2}k(-(x^2))\\
        mgh_f &= \frac{1}{2}mv_x^2 -\frac{1}{2}kx^2\\
        h_f &= \frac{\frac{1}{2}mv_x^2 -\frac{1}{2}kx^2}{mg}
    \end{aligned}
    $$
\end{problem}


\section{Non-Conservative Energy}

Not all energy is conserved and remained in the system - sometimes the energy is lost to the environment as thermal energy and sound energy


\begin{problem}
    A skiier skiis down a ramp in two parts. On the first part, the angle of elevation is $30^\circ$ and the kinetic coefficient of friction is 0.2. Once the skiier reaches the bottom of the slope, the new coefficient of kinetic friction is 0.3. The slope is 70m tall.\\

    a) What is the velocity of the skiier at the bottom of the slope?\\

    b) What is the acceleration of the skiier while he is on the slope?\\

        v_f &= \sqrt{2\left(gh_i - g\cos\theta\mu_k\frac{h_i}{\sin\theta}\right)}\\
        v_f &= \sqrt{2gh_i\left(1 - \frac{\mu_k}{\tan\theta}\right)}\\
        v_f &= 36.374 \frac{\m}{\s}
    \end{aligned}

        a = \frac{v_f^2}{2L}\\
        a = \frac{\m}{\s^2}

    $$

    To solve part c):
    $$
    \begin{aligned}

        D &= \frac{v_i^2}{2\mu_kg}\\

\section{Center of Mass}

\begin{itemize}
    \item A lot of times we are looking at an entire system with a bunch of different objects spread throughout
    \item If this is the case, we want to know where all of the mass for every single object (on average) is concentrated
    \item Finding the point where most of the mass is cnocentrated is called the \textbf{center of mass}
\end{itemize}

\begin{definition}[Center of Mass (1D)]{def4.6.1:label}
    If there are multiple masses $m_1,m_2\dots,m_n$ that are all in 1D space, then the center of mass can be determined using the following equation:

    \[
        m_{c} = \frac{\sum_{i=0}^n m_ix_i}{\sum_{i=0}^n m_i}    
    \]

    Where $x_i$ is the position value for the indicated mass.

\section{Introduction to Momentum}

\begin{definition}[Momentum]{def4.7.1:label}

    \]

    \textbf{momentum} is a vector (it's simply a scaled version of velocity) and the SI units are $\kg \frac{\m}{\s}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{itemize}
    \item linear momentum is \textbf{always conserved}
    \item kinetic energy is only conserved in an \textbf{elastic collision}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{ELASTIC COLLISION}: Where two bodies bounce off of each other
        \item \textit{INELASTIC COLLISION:} When two bodies stick together after the collision
    \end{itemize}
    \item FUN FACT: We can get Newton's second law through differentiating the definition of momentum because $\frac{d}{dt}p = \frac{d}{dt}(mv) \implies F_{net} = ma$
\end{itemize}

\begin{definition}[Impulse]{def4.7.2:label}
    \[
    \vec J = \vec Ft = \Delta \vec p = m(\vec v_f - \vec v_i)
    \]

    \textbf{impulse} is how much is applied to an object over a given period of time
\end{definition}

    A cue ball comes and towards the 6-ball with a speed of $2 \frac{\m}{\s}$. The 6-ball goes down at an angle of $30^\circ$ with a velocity magnitude of $3 \frac{\m}{\s}$. What is the final velocity of the cue ball after the collision?
    
    \[
    \begin{aligned}
        \vec p_i &= \vec p_f\\
        m\vec v_{ci} &= m\vec v_{cf} + m\vec v_6\\
        v_{cf} &= v_{ci}-v_6\\
