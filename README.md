# STEM-Notes
LaTeX code and PDFs for all math notes that I develop for any/all Math/Science classes that I take. All of these are available for download for you to use as you wish. 

If there is any content that I am missing, feel free to open up an issue on GitHub and I will be more than happy to address the problem at hand. These notes are also open-source, so if you would like to add to these notes yourself, you can make a pull request and I will consider whether to incorporate these changes into the final product. 

If you just want the final PDFs of my notes, then you can head to [my website](https://sites.google.com/view/trevorbushnellresources/home)
